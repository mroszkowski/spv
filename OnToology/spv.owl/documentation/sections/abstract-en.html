<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The main contribution of this vocabulary are five specific classes for structuring and collecting the following qualitative characteristics of scholarly papers: research objectives, research methods, research findings, future work, critique. An additional inner structure is proposed for research objectives, qualifying them as schema:StructuredValue and combining them from two lists: research action types and research artifacts. The specific classes are subclasses of schema:ItemList. In addition, the classes for research methods, research action types and research artifacts are declared as subclasses of enumeration. Thus the typical methods, activities and research artifacts of the research area can be listed in the vocabulary itself.</span>
